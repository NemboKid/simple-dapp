###Explanation:

When you change Metamask account, the website won't probably notice it and will still think you have the same account that you started with.
Therefore, please reload the page after each interaction. Horrible, I know. It's the first time I write in javascript and do anything frontend,
so don't be too hard on me about the code style or user experience :) 

I'd love to improve on my code, so please give me feedback also on the frontend and how I could do it. For instance, I wanted to redrirect wrong accounts to 404 pages,
but ended up with some alerts instead...






This is the first time I'm in contact with frontend development, and my website has some flaws.
